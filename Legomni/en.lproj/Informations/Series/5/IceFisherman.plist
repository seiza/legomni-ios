	<key>Description</key>
	<string>The Ice Fisherman might be the most patient person in the world. He’ll carefully choose just the right spot on the ice to drill a hole, then he’ll lower his fishing line and wait…and wait…and wait. He might wait for hours. He might wait for days. Sometimes he even waits for weeks! But eventually, there’s always a tug on the line and up pops his catch.</string>
